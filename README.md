# Verbose

Verbose is the simple logger used in Rebxd and Cryticl, as of now, and written entirely in Golang.
This will be later expanded with more functionality, customization and saving.

It's a color coded system with stuff like TAG, Date+Time, Status and message all neatly organized and colored.

### Example output

<img width="1514" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96a22eb9-201f-4f5f-8c80-26c86e5aaf50" />


### How To Install

```
go get github.com/Reboxed/verbose
```

### Why?

Dunno really, but

> open sourced our simple logging code. xdd. mostly cuz i extracted it out into it's own package to reuse it more easily and i was like "why not open source it".
